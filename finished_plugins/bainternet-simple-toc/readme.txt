== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use? =

*New way

Simpler use the TinyMCE editor button.

*Old way

Simple, place `<---TOC--->` anywhere in you post or page where you want to the TOC to show.
Then for each eading you want added to the TOC add `<---TOC Heading:Heading_name--->` and change `Heading_name` with the actual mane you want the TOC heading link to be.

Now that is the old way, the new way would be to use the new tinymce button I've added to the plugin and simply select what you want to insert for example just click the new tinymce button select "Auto TOC heading" specify an html tag you use for headings like h2 or h3 and click insert.

= How to style the TOC =

I left the styling up to you but if you want the defualt style of wikipedia then add to your styles.css file:
`.toc{
    background-color: #F9F9F9;
    border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;
    padding: 5px;
}`
